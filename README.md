# polysynthesis_project

Code that I used to synthesize data collected by the creators of adyghe.web-corpora.net/index_en.html.

The data input/full output is not here because the files are too large to store on GitHub.

##### clean_sentences.py

### Img_Outputs

These are the plots generated by make_plots.py

### Clean Sentences

These are the cleaned sentences generated by clean_sentences.py
